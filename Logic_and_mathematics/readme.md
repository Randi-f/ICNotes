The first year to combine two courses. Logic and a newly opened one.

Logic part: not too hard. But it focuses on the detailed thing so much. Need care.

Mathematics part: A summary of all Math you learnt from primary school. Too much content to learn and summarize. EXAM is not difficult, but may include something you did not pay too much attention on.
